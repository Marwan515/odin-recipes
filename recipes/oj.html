    <p>Bright and sweet orange juice is delicious to enjoy on its own for a healthy beverage, or include in your favorite drink recipes. And even without a standing juicer it’s very easy to make freshly squeezed orange juice at home. Here I share with you step-by-step instructions for how to make orange juice using a blender or mixer.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>850 grams oranges or 6 to 7 medium oranges</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
        <li>sugar or honey or jaggery as required – (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the oranges and take the orange segments in a mixie jar or blender jar.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. This is optional and you can skip if you want.</li>
        <li>Run the mixie or blender on low to medium speed for some seconds till the mixture becomes pulpy and the oranges are crushed. Avoid blending too much as we just need to crush the segments and not the seeds.</li>
        <li>If the seeds gets crushed, the juice will become bitter. So don't blend at a stretch. You can also use the pulse option of the blender. If you prefer you can remove the orange seeds before juicing them.</li>
        <li>Line a juice strainer over a bowl or pan. In the juice strainer, pour the orange juice.</li>
        <li>Strain the juice with a help of a spoon. Keep on pressing and moving the spoon, so that the all the juice is strained well.</li>
        <li>You should only have the stringy orange pulp remaining after all the juice is strained.</li>
        <li>The juice will be collected in the bowl or pan. If you want you can add some sugar or honey or jaggery to the juice to sweeten it.</li>
        <li>Pour immediately in glasses and serve orange juice.</li>
    </ol>
